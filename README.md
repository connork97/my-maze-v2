# my-maze-v2

The goal of this maze is to utilize both tables in my HTML, CSS styling, and JavaScript funcitons to create a maze (not auto generated, at least not yet).  The user should be able to use arrow keys as input to control the player character's movement, within dictated boundaries, to move from the starting point to the finish line.
